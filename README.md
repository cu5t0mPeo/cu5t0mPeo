# About cu5t0mPeo

Hey friends, I started researching blockchain security in June 2023 and got my own vulnerabilities in code4rena, sherlock, etc. Currently I am an independent blockchain security researcher. Here you can see my competition status on various platforms and some of the CTF competitions I have participated in.
